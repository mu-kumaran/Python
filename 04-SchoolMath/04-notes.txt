1. Arithmetic Operators
2. Relational Operators
3. Logical Operators
4. Membership and Identity Operators
5. Bitwise Operators
6. Walrus Operators

Arithmetic Operator:
--------------------
- Addition +, Subtraction -, Multiplication *,Division /, Modulus %, Exponent ** and Floor division //

eg. a=35
    b=18
    res1=a+b 
    print("a = ",a," b = ",b)
    print("Addition is ",res1)
    print("Subtraction is ",a-b)
    print("Multiplication is ",a*b)
    print("a/b = ",a/b)
    print("a modulus b = ",a%b)
    print("Floor division is ",a//b)    # returns a quotient
    print("Exponential is ",a**b)       # returns a remainder

Comparison Operator:
--------------------
- Greater than >, Less than <, Equal to  ==, Not equal to !=
- Greater than or equal to >=, Less than or equal to <=
- returns a boolean value

eg. age = 18
    reqd_age = 36

    print(age>reqd_age)
    print(age<reqd_age)
    print(age == reqd_age)
    print(age != reqd_age)

Logical Operators
-----------------
- and --> returns True if both of the operand is true
- or --> returns True if either of the operand is true
- not --> returns True if operand is false and vice versa
- returns a boolean value

eg. x = True
    y = False
    print('x = ',x,' y = ',y)
    print('x and y is ',x and y)
    print('x or y is ',x or y)
    print('not x is ', not x)
    print('not y is ', not y)

    num1 = 5
    num2 = 8
    print(num1>num2 or num1<num2)

Membership Operator:
--------------------
in --> return True if the value is found in the sequence and vice versa
not in --> return True if the value is not found in the sequence and vice versa 

eg. name = 'manoj'
    print('a' in name)
    print('x' in name)
    print('m' not in name)
    print('y' not in name)

Identity Operator:
-------------------
- used for checking if two values are located in the same part of the memory
- id() returns the memory address
- is --> returns True if the operands are identical (refers to the same object)
- is not-->  returns True if the operands are not identical (do not refer to the same object)

eg. num1 = 5
    num2 = 5
    num3 = 6
    print(id(num1))
    print(id(num2))
    print(id(num3))
    print(num1 is num2)
    print(num1 is num3)

Walrus Operator (:=):
----------------
- name := expr

eg. name = 'manoj'
    print(name)
    print(name1:='ganesh')
    print(name1+name)
