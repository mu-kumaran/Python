Looping
-------
- Loops = repetition
- A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times

Definite iteration:
------------------
- number of repetitions is specified explicitly in advance
eg. for loop

Indefinite iteration:
---------------------
- code block executes until some condition is met
eg. while loop

range():
-------
syntax:
------
range(start,stop,step)

print(list(range(5)))
print(list(range(1,5)))
print(list(range(1,10,2)))
print(list(range(70,100,5)))

for loop
--------
syntax:
-------
for val in sequence:
    #statements

eg. for i in range(5):
        print(i)

    for i in range(5):
        print("PythonX")

    for i in "PythonX":
        print(i)

while loop:
-----------
while boolean_expression:
    #statements

eg. i=0
    while(i<3):
        print("I love python")
        i = i+1

break statement:
----------------
- used to teminate the loop or statement in which its is present
- control then passes to the statements that are present after the loop block ends
- If the break statement is present in the nested loop, then it terminates only those Loops
  which contain a break statement

eg. To print only 'Good' in the word 'Goodmorning'

    str = "Goodmorning"
    print(str)
    for i in str:
        if(i=='m'):
            break
        else:
            print(i)

for-else statement:
-------------------
- if the else statement is used with for loop, then the else statement is sexecuted when the loop has
  exhausted iterating the list

eg. str = "Goodmorning"
    letter = input("Enter the character you want to find in the given string:") 
    for i in str:
        if(i==letter):
            print(letter,"found")
            break
    else:
        print("letter not found")
