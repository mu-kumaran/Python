API (Application Program Interface)
----------------------------------
- It's simply the softwares talk to each other
- Its a readymade softwares built to serve necessary data.
- Its just a replica of function call, object call and using libraries.
- Input --> Function --> Output model

objective:
---------
- We cannot build everything from the scratch and we don't want large code lines. So we go for the API call.

REST API: (REST - Representational State Transfer)
--------
- It is a web based API call
- Like a Input-Output model, It is a Client-Request ----> Server-Response model via http protocol
- Server giving the response is called Resource/End points/Routing points
- In REST api's we use api keys and url's to access Server

http methods: get, post, put, delete
-------------
get - to read and view the content. eg. to get a news data
post - to insert the data. eg. to add product newly to the cart
put - to update the data. eg. to cancel the transactions, to add/remove the existing product in the shopping cart
delete - to delete the data.  eg. to empty the cart
