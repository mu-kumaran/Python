This HTML code represents a basic online store shopping cart interface. It contains a form to add products and displays the current items in the cart, each with a button to remove them. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the code section by section:

<!DOCTYPE html>
Declares that the document is an HTML5 document.

<html lang="en">
Starts the HTML document and specifies that the language is English.

<head> Section
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Sets the character encoding to UTF-8, which supports most characters.

<title>Online Store</title>: Sets the title of the webpage, shown in the browser tab.

<body> Section
<h1>Shopping Cart</h1>
Displays a main heading for the shopping cart.
