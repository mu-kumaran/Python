Overview of HTTP:
----------------
- When you, the client, use a web page your browser sends an HTTP request to the server where the page is hosted. 
- The server tries to find the desired resource by default "index.html". 
- If your request is successful, the server will send the object to the client in an HTTP response. 
- This includes information like the type of the resource, the length of the resource, and other information.
- The HTTP protocol allows you to send and receive information through the web including webpages, images, and other web resources.

Uniform Resource Locator: URL
-----------------------------
- Uniform resource locator (URL) is the most popular way to find resources on the web. We can break the URL into three parts.
1. scheme - this is this protocol, Mostly it will always be http://
2. Internet address or Base URL - this will be used to find the location here are some examples: www.ibm.com and  www.gitlab.com 
3. route - location on the web server for example: /images/IDSNlogo.png

- We may also hear the term Uniform Resource Identifier (URI), URL are actually a subset of URIs. Another popular term is endpoint, this is the URL of an operation provided by a Web server.
