Exception Handling
------------------
Error in Programming:
--------------------
 - A mistake in the code
 - Something that stops the execution of the program
 - Unexpected behaviour

- Errors are the mistakes or faults in the program that cause it to behave unexpectedly
- Programming error is generally known as bugs and the process to remove bugs from the program is called debugging

Types of errors:
----------------
1. Syntax errors
2. Logic errors
3. Runtime errors

Syntax error:
------------
- Its an error in the source code
- any aspects of the code that do not conform to the syntax of that particular programming language will produce a syntax error. Eg. missing the paranthesis, double quotes etc
- these errors are generally caught by the compiler at the compiler time. And thus are also called compilation errors.

Logic errors:
-------------
- Its an error in the programming Logic
- It will cause your program to perfor, undesired operations that you didn't intend your program to perform
- It occurs generally due to improper logic used in the program, which is not caught by the compiler due to improper logic. It is difficult to debug.
- eg. using / operator instead of % operator for finding the remainder between two numbers  

Runtime errors:
--------------
- errors caught at the run time
- these errors do not have any syntax problem or logic problem.
- These errors are generated when the program is running and leads to abnoraml behaviour or termination of the program
- The general cause of Run time erros is because program is trying to perform an operation that is impossible to carry out. Eg. dividing a number by zero
