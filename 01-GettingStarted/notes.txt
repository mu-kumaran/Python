Python created by  Guido Van Rossum in 1985-1990 which has succeeded the ABC programming language.
It was finally released on 1991
The name Python is inspired from TV show called 'Monty Python flying circus'
It is an object-oriented, general purpose, high level programming language
Python's bulk libraries are very portable and cross platform compatible
python is an dynamic,interpreted(byte-code compiled) language

Types of programmng languages
------------------------------
1. Compiled language:
----------------------
    Language --> Machine code --> Ready to run

    Compiled languages are coverted directly into machine code that processor can execute y the compiler.
    It need a 'build' step that is they need to be compiled manually first for everytime there is a change
    Eg. C,C++,Rust,Go etc
    A program will not execute untill all errors which are pointed out during building are fixed

2. Interpreted language:
-------------------------
    Language --> Ready to run --> Virtual Machine --> Machine code

    Interpreters run through a program line by line and execute each command.
    Eg. PHP, Ruby, Python, Javascript 
    It starts running the code even if there are errors in your program. 
    At each encountered error, execution of the program would stop with the error message highlighting the reason behind the issue 


Versions:
----------

1. Python 2.X (eg 2.7, 2.8, ...)
2. Python 3.X (eg 3.7, 3.8, ...)


Applications:
--------------

1. Web Development  
    not a good choice for Front-end but for back-end development using framworks such as Django, Flask
    Django used for full fledged heavy weight applications and Flask used for light weight applications
2. App Development (both mobile and desktop)
    Kivy is used to develop cross platofor mobile applications
3. Data Science
4. Machine Learning
    Libraries such as Keras, Sci-kit learn etc used for creating very powerful ML models 
5. Internet of Things
6. Embedded programming
7. Computer vision
8. Automation etc...

Real life Use Case:
-------------------

ForecastWatch.com is the business of rating then accuracy of weather reports from Accuweather, MyForecast.com and The Weather Channel
ForecastWatch.com is a 100% pure Python solution.
It's web interface was originally written in PHP but later changed to Python
