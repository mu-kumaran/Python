MySQL connection:
----------------
- To interact with database via our application, we need to connect our application with the database.
- To connect MySQL with python we use MySQL connector.
- MySQL connector is a driver for connecting to a MySQL database server through the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) application program interface (API), which is the standard means of connecting to any database.
- MySQL provides various database connectors. Since we want to work with Python, we will use the Python Driver for MySQL which is a Python connector.

mysql.connector
---------------
- We connect our Python application with the MySQL database using a Python module named mysql.connector
- It is a third-party module that allows us to interact with the MySQL database.
- Since it is not a built-in-module, we will need to install it before using it.
 
 command: pip install mysql-connector
 -------

 Creating connection:
 -------------------
Step - 1: Import the library
--------
- Import the mysql.connector module in your Python script.
 
 code: 
 ----
 import mysql.connector

 Step - 2: Establish a connection
 ---------
- Use the mysql.connector.connect() method to connect to the MySQL server.
- Provide the necessary credentials such as host, user, password, and database (if you want to connect to a specific database).

code:
-----
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="your_host_name",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",
        database="your_database"
    )

Here,
- mydb is the database variable that we create to make the connection. We will use this object for further database interaction.
- mysql.connector.connect() is how we make the call to the connect() method
