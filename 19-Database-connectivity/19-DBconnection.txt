MySQL connection:
----------------
- To interact with database via our application, we need to connect our application with the database.
- To connect MySQL with python we use MySQL connector.
- MySQL connector is a driver for connecting to a MySQL database server through the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) application program interface (API), which is the standard means of connecting to any database.
- MySQL provides various database connectors. Since we want to work with Python, we will use the Python Driver for MySQL which is a Python connector.

mysql.connector
---------------
- We connect our Python application with the MySQL database using a Python module named mysql.connector
- It is a third-party module that allows us to interact with the MySQL database.
- Since it is not a built-in-module, we will need to install it before using it.
 
 command: pip install mysql-connector-python
 -------

 Creating connection:
 -------------------
Step - 1: Import the library
--------
- Import the mysql.connector module in your Python script.
 
 code: 
 ----
 import mysql.connector

 Step - 2: Establish a connection
 ---------
- Use the mysql.connector.connect() method to connect to the MySQL server.
- Provide the necessary credentials such as host, user, password, and database (if you want to connect to a specific database).

code:
-----
mydb = mysql.connector.connect(
        host="your_host_name",
        user="your_username",
        password="your_password",   //passwd = "password"
        database="your_database"
    )

Here,
- mydb is the database variable that we create to make the connection. We will use this object for further database interaction.
- mysql.connector.connect() is how we make the call to the connect() method.
- It takes three or four parameters to create a database connection. The first one is the name of the host or the host machine. Next are username and the password of our MySQL that you might have set while installing MySQL in your systems and database if you want to connect to specific database.

eg. import mysql.connector
    myDB = mysql.connector.connect(
        host = "localhost",
        user="root",
        password = "hWsjr8+i#"
    )

    print(myDB)

output: <mysql.connector.connection_cext.CMySQLConnection object at 0x00000129CC6FDA90>

- since we are using MySQL in local machine, hostname will be localhost. In most of the cases default username is root. Password is our MySQL password entered while installing it.
