Library management app
-----------------------
In this project, we will create a Library Management Application which will have the following functionalities,
- Fetch all the available books in the library
- Add new books
- Keep a track of borrowed books
- Update the details based on the books returned 

Project flow
------------
- The very first step from the user's point of view would be to display the menu of the library management application.
- Following would be the main menu options
1. Display Books
2. Lend a Book
3. Add a Book
4. Return a Book

- Depending on the choice entered, we would need to perform the operation and return the details to the output screen.
- The above process has to be done repeatedly until the user quits.

if __name__ == '__main__': is the entry point of the interpreter instead of top down apporach

Further Enhancements: (Updating software)
-----------------------------------------
- Implement a database for the books borrowed - borrowed books list database
- Implement a method that returns the record of the books that have been borrowed with the name of the person who has borrowed the book
- Implement a new method to remove the books
- So the project flow will be added with new menu options
5. Display Books borrowed
6. Remove a Book
